It is commonly known as the corpse flower or giant padma. It is noted for producing the largest individual flower on Earth.<br><br>It is noted to have a strong and unpleasant odour akin to that of decaying flesh.">
      <img src="images/bengkuluensis.png" class="circle-img img2" data-title="Rafflesia bengkuluensis" data-text="Rafflesia bengkuluensis is a relatively new parasitic plant species of the genus Rafflesia. It is native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra.<br><br>It was discovered after extensive research of R. arnoldii by the Department of Forest University of Bengkulu when they noticed some organisms being significantly smaller and were eventually classified as a separate species.">
      <img src="images/gadutensis.png" class="circle-img img3" data-title="Rafflesia gadutensis" data-text="Rafflesia gadutensis is a parasitic plant species of the genus Rafflesia. It is native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. R. gadutensis was named after the place where it was first collected, Ulu Gadut, in West Sumatra.">
      <img src="images/hasseltii.png" class="circle-img img4" data-title="Rafflesia hasseltii" data-text="Rafflesia hasseltii is a parasitic plant species of the genus Rafflesia and the family Rafflesiaceae which is hosted by certain Tetrastigma species.

      <img src="images/patma.png" class="circle-img img5" data-title="Rafflesia patma" data-text="Rafflesia patma is a parasitic plant species that is only known to grow on the Indonesian island of Java, although it may have occurred on Sumatra in the past (and may still occur there). Like other species in its genus, this plant has no leaves, stems, roots or chlorophyll, instead stealing all its nutrition from Tetrastigma lanceolaurium, a rainforest liana.">

It is exclusively found in Bukit Lawang, a small tourist village in Mount Leuser National Park, North Sumatra, Indonesia. Previously misidentified as Rafflesia arnoldii, photographs taken in 2005 led to the eventual separation of Rafflesia lawangensis as a distinct species in 2010.">

It was first described by Harry Wiriadinata and Rismita Sari in 2010. It is known from a single location, Sicikeh-Cikeh, a nature park in North Sumatra.">
      <img src="images/zollingeriana.png" class="circle-img img8" data-title="Rafflesia zollingeriana" data-text="Rafflesia zollingeriana is a species of flowering plant in the family Rafflesiaceae, native to Java. Of three species of Rafflesia known from Java this species has always been the most rare and restricted, it is only known from collection locales in Banyuwangi Regency, Jember Regency and Lumajang Regency, southern East Java.">
